# 2026-02-13 Daily Log

## Overview
**Date:** 2026-02-13 (Saturday)  
**Session:** Main (Telegram)  
**Status:** System initialization and configuration day

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Memory System Architecture ✅
- **Decision:** Implemented three-layer memory architecture (Daily/Weekly/Hourly)
- **Rationale:** Prevent context loss between sessions, enable semantic search
- **Implementation:** 4 cron jobs configured

### 2. Backup Strategy ✅
- **Decision:** Manual backup only (no auto-backup cron)
- **Rationale:** User wants full control over when backups happen
- **Status:** Script ready at `scripts/auto-backup.sh`

### 3. Token Pricing & Reporting ✅
- **Decision:** Daily cost report at 23:00 with Kimi K2.5 pricing
- **Pricing:** Input ¥0.0000042/token, Output ¥0.000021/token
- **Status:** Cron job configured

### 4. NVIDIA API Integration ❌
- **Decision:** Not implemented (API key has read-only access)
- **Status:** Abandoned, using existing Moonshot/Kimi instead

### 5. Content Creation System ✅
- **Decision:** Created dedicated fengshui-content skill
- **Features:** 4 content templates, hashtag strategy, quick creation workflow
- **Status:** Ready for Twitter content production

---

## Learnings & Insights

1. **Memory architecture is critical** - The three-layer system (Daily/Weekly/Hourly + Vector Search) provides comprehensive coverage without overwhelming the context window.

2. **Manual control preference** - User explicitly prefers manual backups and selective automation, indicating high trust but desire for oversight.

3. **Token cost awareness** - At ¥0.000021/output token, 1M tokens = ¥21. Daily tracking will help manage costs.

4. **Skill-based approach works** - Creating dedicated skills (fengshui-content) for specific tasks provides clear boundaries and reusable patterns.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Complete Twitter content for today (compensate for missed 16:30 slot)
2. **Tonight:** First automated Daily Memory Sync at 23:00
3. **Tomorrow:** First Hourly Micro-Sync sequence begins
4. **Sunday:** First Weekly Memory Compound

---

## Additional Updates (Post 17:00)

### 6. Browser Automation Test ✅
- **Achievement:** Successfully posted tweet via Chrome browser automation
- **Process:** 
  - Connected to Chrome extension relay (port 18792)
  - Navigated to x.com/home
  - Composed and published tweet about router fengshui
  - Verified post appeared on timeline
- **Status:** Browser automation operational for future content publishing

### 7. Additional Skills Created ✅
- **system-essentials skill:** Core system configuration and user preferences
- **parallel-subagents skill:** Task decomposition and parallel processing strategy
- **Total skills:** 4 (fengshui-content, qmd, system-essentials, parallel-subagents)

### 8. AGENTS.md Rules Updated ✅
- **Memory Retrieval Rule:** Mandatory qmd search before file reading
- **Post-Write Rule:** Must run `qmd update && qmd embed` after memory writes
- **Reasoning:** "Like looking up a word in dictionary - use index, not read cover to cover"

---

## Session Summary

**Total Tasks Completed:** 11 major configurations + 1 successful tweet publication
**System Status:** Fully operational with 4 cron jobs, 4 skills, automated memory management
**Next Milestone:** First automated Daily Memory Sync at 23:00 tonight

### 12. Final Strategy Decisions (17:35-17:45)

**Heartbeat Content Publishing Mode:**
- Changed from fixed schedule (4x/day) to heartbeat mode (every 4 hours with random delays)
- Quality over quantity: 1-2 high-quality tweets per day
- Mimics natural human posting patterns

**Growth-First Strategy Confirmed:**

- Tertiary: Monetization (after reaching growth milestones)

**Cost Control Balance:**
- Decision: Maintain ¥66/month configuration (not radical cost-cutting)
- Rationale: Growth requires investment; complete cost-cutting stops growth
- Philosophy: "Save money but don't stop operating"

**Final Configuration:**
- 6 cron jobs active (heartbeat publish, engagement, memory sync)
- 4 skills operational
- Full autonomous authority with clear boundaries
- Ready for long-term operation

### 13. Triple-Model Synergy System Deployed (18:00-18:30)

**Architecture Established:**
- **Kimi K2.5** (Commander/CEO): Strategy, creativity, complex decisions
- **Qwen** (Executor): Fast execution, content writing, operations
- **DeepSeek** (Tech Lead/CTO): Code, data analysis, logic reasoning

**DeepSeek API Integration:**
- API Key: `sk-5d523d54b0e448a9bb9f274088694e95`
- Models: `deepseek-chat` (general), `deepseek-reasoner` (reasoning)
- Cost: ¥1/1M tokens (90% cheaper than GPT-4)
- Configuration: Added to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Environment: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set in `~/.zshrc`

**Collaboration Test Results:**
- Task: Analyze tweet data + plan tomorrow's content
- Time: 39 seconds total
- Cost: ¥0.11 (vs ¥0.25 single-model)
- Savings: 56% cost, 37% faster
- Quality: Professional JSON output + actionable plans

**Workflow Validated:**
```
DeepSeek: Data analysis → Qwen: Content creation → Kimi: Decision making
```

**Current Cost:** ¥66/month (¥2.2/day)
**Team:** Kimi (Commander) + DeepSeek-chat (Executor) + DeepSeek-reasoner (Tech Lead)
**Strategy:** Growth-first, heartbeat publishing, ultra-precision outreach

---

### 15. Qwen Replaced by DeepSeek Dual-Model (19:10-19:20)

**Decision:** Cancel Qwen configuration, use DeepSeek dual-model instead

**Rationale:**
- Qwen configuration too complex (requires browser cookie extraction)
- DeepSeek-chat can handle all executor tasks with high quality
- DeepSeek-reasoner specializes in technical/code tasks
- Both models already configured and tested

**New Architecture:**
```
Kimi K2.5 (Commander) 
    ↓
DeepSeek-chat (Executor) - ¥1/1M tokens -文案、回复、整理
DeepSeek-reasoner (Tech Lead) - ¥4/1M tokens -代码、分析、推理
```

**Cost Optimization:**
- Original 3-model (Kimi+Qwen+DeepSeek): ¥40/month
- New 3-model (Kimi+DS-chat+DS-reasoner): ¥30/month
- Savings: 25%

**Test Results:**
- DeepSeek-chat wrote sample tweet in 7s
- Quality: Natural, humorous, well-structured
- Cost: ~¥0.001 per task
- Verdict: Fully capable of replacing Qwen

**Configuration Updated:**
- `triple-model-synergy/SKILL.md` - Updated role definitions
- `RECOVERY.md` - Documented new architecture
- `openclaw.json` - Already had DeepSeek configured

**Next Actions:**
1. Await pricing table from user for final cost calibration
2. Begin operational tasks with new team structure
3. Monitor cost and quality metrics

### 16. Final Price Configuration & Account Balance (19:20-19:25)

**Price Update:**
| Model | Input(命中) | Input(未命中) | Output |
|-------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Kimi K2.5 | ¥0.70/百万 | ¥4.00/百万 | ¥21.00/百万 |
| DeepSeek-chat | ¥0.20/百万 | ¥2.00/百万 | ¥3.00/百万 |
| DeepSeek-reasoner | ¥0.20/百万 | ¥2.00/百万 | ¥3.00/百万 |

**Account Balance:**
- Kimi API: ¥14.36 (~28 days)
- DeepSeek API: ¥5.99 → **充值¥50** → ¥55.99 (~37 days)
- Total: ¥70.35 (sufficient for 2.3 months)

**Cost Tracker Created:**
- File: `reports/token-cost-tracker.md`
- Purpose: Real-time tracking of API consumption
- Alert thresholds: <7 days (yellow), <3 days (red)

### 17. Full Autonomous Execution Authorization (19:25-20:05)

**Decision:** User granted complete operational authority to the team

**User's Position:**
- "我只负责发布任务，怎么执行我不管我也不懂，我只看结果"
- "三个大脑总比我一个大脑好用"

**Team's Authority:**
- Autonomous decisions on: content, timing, engagement, optimization (<¥50)
- Must report to user: expenses >¥50, account banned, strategy changes

**Execution Plan Finalized:**
| Time | Task | Model |
|------|------|-------|
| 08:00 | Daily report | DeepSeek-reasoner |
| Heartbeat | Content publishing | DeepSeek-chat |
| Every 8h | Ultra-precision outreach | DeepSeek-chat |
| 23:00 | Memory sync | System |

**Targets:**
- Daily fan growth: 10-20
- Monthly: 300-600
- 3-month goal: 5,000

### 18. GLM Coding Lite Purchase Decision (20:03-20:04)

**Offer:** GLM Coding Lite annual subscription ¥411/year (30% off)

**Decision:** **NOT PURCHASED**

**Reasoning:**
- Function overlap: DeepSeek-reasoner already handles all coding tasks
- Budget constraint: Current ¥30/month budget, GLM adds ¥34/month
- No monetization yet: Every expense must be justified
- Sufficient capability: DeepSeek programming ability validated

**Future Consideration:**
- Re-evaluate when: code demand >100M tokens/day, or revenue generated
